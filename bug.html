<p>This is a common error, but it can be difficult to track down.  The problem is that the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> symbols are not being properly encoded.</p><p>Here's an example of how it can happen:</p><code><div>This &lt;div&gt; tag should have been encoded as &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;.</div></code><p>The browser interprets these as HTML tags instead of plain text, which leads to unexpected behavior.</p>
